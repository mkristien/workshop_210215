1700
Nicole-Reine Etable de la Brière Lepaute was one of a team of human computers who worked with Alexis-Claude Clairaut and Joseph-Jérôme Le Français de Lalande to predict the date of the return of Halley's Comet.[1] They began work on the calculations in 1757, working throughout the day and sometimes during mealtimes.[2] Their methods were followed by successive human computers.[3] They divided large calculations into "independent pieces, assembled the results from each piece into a final product" and then checked for errors.[3] Lepaute continued to work on computing for the rest of her life, working for the Connaissance des Temps and publishing predictions of solar eclipses.[4]

1970
Pam Hardt-English led a group to create a computer network they named Resource One and which was part of a group called Project One.  
Her idea to connect Bay Area bookstores, libraries and Project One was an early prototype of the Internet. To work on the project, Hardt-English 
obtained an expensive SDS-940 computer as a donation from TransAmerica Leasing Corporation in April 1972. They created an electronic library and housed it 
in a record store called Leopold's in Berkeley. This became the Community Memory database and was maintained by hacker, Jude Milhon. 
 After 1975, the SDS-940 computer was repurposed by Sherry Reson, Mya Shone, Chris Macie and Mary Janowitz to create a social services database 
 and a Social Services Referral Directory. Hard copies of the directory, printed out as a subscription service, were kept at city buildings and libraries. 
 the database was maintained and in use until 2009.
