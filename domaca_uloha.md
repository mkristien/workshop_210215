Nicole-Reine Etable de la Brière Lepaute was one of a team of human computers who worked with Alexis-Claude Clairaut and Joseph-Jérôme Le Français de Lalande to predict the date of the return of Halley's Comet.[1] They began work on the calculations in 1757, working throughout the day and sometimes during mealtimes.[2] Their methods were followed by successive human computers.[3] They divided large calculations into "independent pieces, assembled the results from each piece into a final product" and then checked for errors.[3] Lepaute continued to work on computing for the rest of her life, working for the Connaissance des Temps and publishing predictions of solar eclipses.[4]

One of the first computers for the American Nautical Almanac was Maria Mitchel.[5] Her work on the assignment was to compute the motion of the planet Venus.[6] The Almanac never became a reality, but Mitchell became the first astronomy professor at Vassar.
