### 1700s
[Nicole-Reine Lepaute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole-Reine_Lepaute) (née Étable de la Briere; also known as Hartense Lepaute or Hortense Lepaute), (5 January 1723 – 6 December 1788) was a French astronomer and mathematician. Lepaute predicted the return of Halley's Comet by calculating the timing of a solar eclipse and constructing a group of catalogs for the stars.

#### Ada Lovelace

[Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She is believed by some to be the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of computers and as one of the first computer programmers.
Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as "poetical science" and herself as an "Analyst (& Metaphysician)".

### 1960s

#### **Margaret Heafield Hamilton**  
[Margaret Heafield Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)) (born August 17, 1936) is an American _computer scientist, systems engineer_, and business owner. She was director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for **NASA's Apollo program**. She later founded two software companies—Higher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton Technologies in 1986, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  
Hamilton has published more than 130 papers, proceedings and reports about sixty projects and six major programs. She is one of the people credited with coining the term "**software engineering**".  
On November 22, 2016, Hamilton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from president Barack Obama for her work leading to the development of on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Moon missions.

### 1920s

In the early 1920s, Iowa State College, professor George Snedecor worked to improve the school's science and engineering departments, experimenting with new punch-card machines and calculators.[35] Snedecor also worked with human calculators most of them women, including Mary Clem.[36] Clem coined the term "zero check" to help identify errors in calculations.[36] The computing lab, run by Clem, became one of the most powerful computing facilities of the time.[36][37]
